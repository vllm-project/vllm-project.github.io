As a passionate vLLM community member who wants to see vLLM thrive and reach even more developers, I'm excited to announce **[vLLM Playground](https://github.com/micytao/vllm-playground)** – a modern, feature-rich web interface for managing and interacting with vLLM servers. Whether you're developing locally on macOS, testing on Linux with GPUs, or deploying to enterprise Kubernetes/OpenShift clusters, vLLM Playground provides a unified, intuitive experience for working with vLLM.

## Why vLLM Playground?

Setting up and managing vLLM servers often requires command-line expertise, container orchestration knowledge, and familiarity with various configuration options. vLLM Playground eliminates these barriers by providing:

- **Zero Setup Required**: No manual vLLM installation – containers handle everything automatically
- **One-Click Operations**: Start/stop servers, switch models, and adjust configurations through an intuitive UI
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on macOS (Apple Silicon), Linux (CPU/GPU), and enterprise Kubernetes environments
- **Same UI Everywhere**: Identical experience from local development to cloud deployment

## Vision and Roadmap

The goal of vLLM Playground is simple: **keep pace with the official vLLM project and make every new feature accessible and easy to try out**.

vLLM is evolving rapidly with powerful capabilities—structured outputs, tool calling, speculative decoding, multi-modal support, and more. However, exploring these features often requires diving into documentation, writing scripts, and managing configurations. vLLM Playground bridges that gap by providing a visual, interactive interface where you can experiment with new vLLM features the moment they're released.

**What's next on the roadmap:**

- **🔗 MCP Server Integration**: Model Context Protocol for enhanced tool capabilities
- **➕ RAG Support**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for knowledge-grounded responses
- **🎯 Feature Parity**: Continuously adding UI support for new vLLM capabilities as they land

## Quick Start

Getting started is as simple as:

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install vllm-playground

# Pre-download container image (optional, ~10GB for GPU)
vllm-playground pull

# Start the playground
vllm-playground
```

Open http://localhost:7860, click "Start Server", and you're running vLLM! The container orchestrator automatically handles pulling the right image for your platform and managing the vLLM lifecycle.

## Key Features

### 🎨 Modern Dark-Themed UI

The new interface features a sleek, professional design with:

- **Streamlined Chat Interface**: Clean, distraction-free chat UI with inline expandable panels
- **Icon Toolbar**: Quick access to advanced features like settings, system prompts, structured outputs, and tool calling
- **Real-time Metrics**: Token counting and generation speed displayed for every response
- **Resizable Panels**: Customize your layout for optimal workflow

### 🏗️ Structured Outputs

Constrain model responses to specific formats with four powerful modes:

| Mode | Description | Example Use Case |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **Choice** | Force output to specific values | Sentiment analysis (positive/negative/neutral) |
| **Regex** | Match output to regex patterns | Email, phone, date format validation |
| **JSON Schema** | Generate valid JSON matching your schema | API responses, structured data extraction |
| **Grammar (EBNF)** | Define complex output structures | Custom DSLs, formal languages |

### 🔧 Tool Calling / Function Calling

Enable models to use custom tools and functions you define:

- **Server-side Configuration**: Enable in Server Configuration panel before starting
- **Auto-detected Parsers**: Automatic parser selection for Llama 3.x, Mistral, Hermes, Qwen, Granite, and InternLM
- **Preset Tools**: Weather, Calculator, and Search tools included
- **Custom Tool Creation**: Define tools with name, description, and JSON Schema parameters
- **Parallel Tool Calls**: Support for multiple simultaneous tool invocations

### 🐳 Container Orchestration

vLLM Playground manages vLLM in isolated containers, providing:

- **Automatic Lifecycle Management**: Start, stop, health checks, and log streaming
- **Smart Container Reuse**: Fast restarts when configuration hasn't changed
- **Cross-Platform Images**:
  - GPU: `vllm/vllm-openai:v0.11.0` (official)
  - CPU x86: `quay.io/rh_ee_micyang/vllm-cpu:v0.11.0`
  - macOS ARM64: `quay.io/rh_ee_micyang/vllm-mac:v0.11.0`

### 📊 GuideLLM Benchmarking Integration

Comprehensive performance testing powered by [GuideLLM](https://github.com/neuralmagic/guidellm):

- Request statistics (success rate, duration, average times)
- Token throughput analysis (mean/median tokens per second)
- Latency percentiles (P50, P75, P90, P95, P99)
- Configurable load patterns and request rates
- JSON export for detailed analysis

### 📚 vLLM Community Recipes

One-click model configurations from the official [vLLM Recipes Repository](https://github.com/vllm-project/recipes):

- **17+ Model Categories**: DeepSeek, Qwen, Llama, Mistral, InternVL, GLM, NVIDIA Nemotron, and more
- **Searchable Catalog**: Filter by model name, category, or tags
- **One-Click Loading**: Auto-fill optimized vLLM settings instantly
- **Hardware Guidance**: See recommended GPU configurations for each model

### ☸️ OpenShift/Kubernetes Deployment

Enterprise-ready cloud deployment with:

- Dynamic vLLM pod creation via Kubernetes API
- GPU and CPU mode support with automatic detection
- RBAC-based security model
- Automated deployment scripts
- Same UI and workflow as local setup

```bash
cd openshift/
./deploy.sh --gpu    # For GPU clusters
./deploy.sh --cpu    # For CPU-only clusters
```

## Architecture Overview

vLLM Playground uses a hybrid architecture that works seamlessly in both local and cloud environments:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     Web UI (FastAPI)                        │
│              app.py + index.html + static/                  │
└────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┘
                         │
                         ├─→ container_manager.py (Local)
                         │   └─→ Podman CLI
                         │       └─→ vLLM Container
                         │
                         └─→ kubernetes_container_manager.py (Cloud)
                             └─→ Kubernetes API
                                 └─→ vLLM Pods
```

The container manager is swapped at build time (Podman → Kubernetes), ensuring identical user experience locally and in the cloud.

## macOS Apple Silicon Support

Full support for macOS with ARM64:

- CPU-optimized container images built specifically for Apple Silicon
- Automatic platform detection
- Rootless container execution via Podman
- Pre-configured CPU settings for optimal performance

```bash
# Just start the Web UI - it handles containers automatically
python run.py
# Or use the CLI
vllm-playground
```

## CLI Commands

```bash
vllm-playground                    # Start with defaults
vllm-playground --port 8080        # Custom port
vllm-playground pull               # Pre-download GPU image (~10GB)
vllm-playground pull --cpu         # Pre-download CPU image
vllm-playground pull --all         # Pre-download all images
vllm-playground stop               # Stop running instance
