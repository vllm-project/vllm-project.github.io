We are excited to release [NVIDIA Nemotron Nano 2 VL](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-VL-BF16), supported by vLLM. This open vision language model ([VLM](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/vision-language-models/)) is built for video understanding and document intelligence.

Nemotron Nano 2 VL uses a hybrid Transformer–Mamba design and delivers higher throughput while maintaining state-of-the-art multimodal reasoning accuracy. The model also features [**Efficient Video Sampling (EVS)**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14624), a new technique that reduces redundant [tokens](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-tokens-explained/) generation for video workloads, allowing processing of more videos with higher efficiency. 

In this blog post, we’ll explore how Nemotron Nano 2 VL advances video understanding and document intelligence, showcase real-world use cases and benchmark results, and guide you through getting started with vLLM for inference to unlock high-efficiency multimodal AI at scale.

## Leading multimodal model for efficient video understanding and document intelligence 

NVIDIA Nemotron Nano 2 VL brings both video understanding and document intelligence capabilities together in a single, highly efficient model. Built on the hybrid Transformer–Mamba architecture, it combines the reasoning strength of Transformer models with the compute efficiency of Mamba, achieving high throughput and low latency, allowing it to process multi-image inputs faster. 

Trained on NVIDIA-curated, high-quality multimodal data, [Nemotron Nano 2 VL](https://huggingface.co/blog/nvidia/nemotron-vlm-dataset-v2) leads in video understanding and document intelligence benchmarks such as MMMU, MathVista, AI2D, OCRBench, OCRBench-v2, OCR-Reasoning, ChartQA, DocVQA, and Video-MME, delivering top-tier accuracy in multimodal [reasoning](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/ai-reasoning/), character recognition, chart reasoning, and visual question answering. This makes it ideal for building multimodal applications that automate data extraction and comprehension across videos, documents, forms, and charts with enterprise-grade precision.

### Improving Efficiency with EVS  
With EVS, the model achieves higher throughput and faster response times without sacrificing accuracy. EVS technique prunes redundant frames, preserving semantic richness while enabling longer video processing efficiently. As a result, enterprises can analyze hours of footage, from meetings and training sessions to customer calls, in minutes, gaining actionable insights faster and at lower cost.

## Run optimized inference with vLLM

This guide demonstrates how to run Nemotron Nano 2 VL on vLLM, achieving accelerated [inference](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/ai-inference/) and serving concurrent requests efficiently with BF16, FP8 and FP4 precision support.

### Install vLLM

The support for Nemotron Nano 2 VL is available in the nightly version of vLLM. Run the command below to install vLLM:
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install vllm --extra-index-url https://wheels.vllm.ai/nightly --prerelease=allow
```


### Deploy and query the inference server
Deploy an OpenAI-compatible inference server with vLLM by running the following commands for BF16, FP8 and FP4 precision:

```bash
vllm serve nvidia/Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-VL-BF16 --trust-remote-code --dtype bfloat16 --video-pruning-rate 0

# FP8
vllm serve nvidia/Nemotron-Nano-VL-12B-V2-FP8 --trust-remote-code --quantization modelopt --video-pruning-rate 0

# FP4
vllm serve nvidia/Nemotron-Nano-VL-12B-V2-FP4-QAD --trust-remote-code --quantization modelopt_fp4 --video-pruning-rate 0
```

Once the server is up and running, you can prompt the model using the below code snippet:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1", api_key="null")
# Simple chat completion
resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="nvidia/Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-VL-BF16",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "/no_think"},
        {"role": "user", "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": "Give me 3 interesting facts about this image."}, 
            {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gamescom-g-assist-nv-blog-1280x680-1.jpg"}
            }
            ]},
    ],
    temperature=0.0,
    max_tokens=1024,
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
```
