For a long time, [vllm.ai](https://vllm.ai) simply redirects to the [vLLM github page](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm). Thanks to the community, we now have a brand-new [vllm.ai](https://vllm.ai) website, drawing inspiration from pytorch.org.

It also features an installation selector to guide users for installing vLLM in various environments.

The motivation is clear: we need to separate the maintenance of community events/logistics updates from the github project. Before the new website, almost all information about vLLM is hosted in the github project. And event announcement/meetup slides are all added through pull-requests, bringing unnecessary burden to developers.

Going forward, we will move most of community events/logistics updates from the github project to the vLLM website, so that the github project can be more focused about code development.

One potential drawback is that people cannot submit pull-requests to request changes as currently done. To solve this problem, we create an email website-feedback@vllm.ai . If anyone has any suggestions to improve the website, please send an email to this address, and we will review and update.

Besides the new website, we also added several new emails for community communication purpose:

* **talentpool@vllm.ai** - Submit your resume for internships & full-time positions, and we will forward the resumes to our partner companies to give more exposure to your resumes. LLM inference is in high demand, and our partner companies are eager to take more experienced engineers.
* **collaboration@vllm.ai** - For partner companies interested in accessing resumes, organizing meetups, or technical partnerships. We are open to collaborate with any company that is interested in using vLLM in their products or services. This will gradually replace the existing functionality of vllm-questions@lists.berkeley.edu .
* **social-promotion@vllm.ai** - For social media promotion collaborations (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, RedNote). If you have anything interesting to share about vLLM, please send an email to this address, and we will review and promote.
