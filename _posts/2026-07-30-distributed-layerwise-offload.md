## TL;DR

vLLM-Omni's Distributed Layerwise Offload enables video generation models larger than single-device HBM (e.g., Cosmos3-Super 64B / 124 GB) to run across multiple NPUs or GPUs with minimal host memory overhead. The stack includes:

- **Meta-device initialization + mmap weight loading**: Weights are loaded as mmap views pointing to shared OS page cache, eliminating O(dp_size × model_size) RSS during model creation. Cold-start peak RSS drops by 73% (178 GB → 47 GB for Cosmos3-Nano DP4).
- **Weight sharding + AllGather**: Each rank stores only 1/dp_size of the model. Full layer weights are reconstructed at runtime via AllGather, overlapped with computation on dedicated streams.
- **Fixed double-buffer scheme**: Exactly 2 layers of weights reside on each device at any time, regardless of model size. In the measured 720p 10s workload, peak HBM grew about 22% (23.1 → 28.1 GB) from the 17B to the 64B model; idle HBM grew about 27% (11.5 → 14.6 GB).
- **DP multi-concurrency**: Each DP rank processes a different request in parallel, achieving 3.3× throughput vs. single-request HSDP — about 83% of the ideal 4× scaling.
- **Platform-agnostic**: Works on both NVIDIA GPU (CUDA/NCCL) and Ascend NPU (CANN/HCCL) via vLLM-Omni's platform abstraction layer.
- **Topology-aware on 8× B300**: Within three evaluated MiniMax-H3 routes, AllGather is best for DP1×SP8 latency and the DP4×SP2 balanced point, while rank-local DLO wins at DP8×SP1 with 183.78 videos/h and 43.97 Wh/video.

In the measured Ascend 910B3 DLO+AllGather runs with Cosmos3-Nano (33 GB) and Cosmos3-Super (124 GB), all configurations produced correct video output and cgroup-visible host memory scaled as O(model_size + dp_size × constant) instead of O(dp_size × model_size). The no-AllGather mode retains a full host copy per rank, while CUDA process-memory accounting includes pinned shards and is reported separately below.

## Quickstart

```bash
# 4× NPU or GPU — Cosmos3-Nano with DP=4
vllm serve /path/to/Cosmos3-Nano --omni \
    --enable-distributed-layerwise-offload \
    --data-parallel-size 4

# 2× devices — Cosmos3-Super (124 GB) with DP=2
vllm serve /path/to/Cosmos3-Super --omni \
    --enable-distributed-layerwise-offload \
    --data-parallel-size 2

# Disable AllGather (each rank loads full weights, no sharding)
vllm serve /path/to/Cosmos3-Nano --omni \
    --enable-distributed-layerwise-offload \
    --data-parallel-size 4 \
    --dlo-no-use-allgather
```

The `--dlo-use-allgather` / `--dlo-no-use-allgather` flag controls whether weights are sharded (default: sharded). When disabled, each rank loads full weights independently — useful when AllGather synchronization overhead outweighs the memory savings.

## The Problem: Large Diffusion Models vs. HBM and Host Memory

Cosmos3-Super (64B parameters, 124 GB in BF16) cannot fit on a single 64 GB HBM device. Existing solutions fall into two families — **offloaders**, which stream weights from host memory, and **parallelism**, which shards resident work across devices — but each has limitations:

![Why Distributed Layerwise Offload is needed](/assets/figures/2026-07-30-distributed-layerwise-offload/dlo-problem-overview.svg)

*Figure 1: Offloader and parallelism alternatives for Cosmos3-Super. HSDP uses about 31 GB of weights plus roughly 25 GB of activations and communication buffers per card (about 56 GB total), leaving only 8 GB of headroom; DLO keeps only two layers in HBM while sharding host weights.*

| Approach | Device HBM | Host Memory per Rank | Limitation |
|----------|:----------:|:--------------------:|------------|
| HSDP (FSDP2) | model / N | 0 | HBM fills up: 64B → 56 GB/card (8 GB headroom) |
| Layerwise offload | 2 layers only | full model | N × model_size host RAM (4 × 124 GB = 496 GB) |
| Tensor Parallel | model / N | 0 | Activation scaling helps, but communication overhead |
| Dist. Layerwise (ours) | 2 layers only | model / N | Requires AllGather synchronization |

For multi-device deployments, the host memory bottleneck is the killer: traditional layerwise offload stores a full copy of the model on each rank's host memory. With 4 devices, that's 4 × 124 GB = 496 GB — more than most servers have.

Worse, during model loading, each rank independently calls `param.data.copy_(loaded_weight)`, creating dp_size complete private copies in RSS. Peak RSS scales as O(dp_size × model_size), reaching 2 TB for a 200B model with dp_size=4.

## Solution Overview

Distributed Layerwise Offload addresses both the HBM and host memory bottlenecks through four techniques that stack together:

| Technique | Problem It Addresses | Primary Benefit |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Meta device + mmap | O(dp_size × model) RSS during loading | -73% cold-start peak RSS |
| Weight sharding + AllGather | N × model_size host memory | 1× model_size total (shared page cache) |
| Double-buffer prefetch | All weights on device | Only 2 layers on HBM at any time |
| DP multi-concurrency | Serial request processing | 3.3× throughput via N parallel requests |

Each technique builds on the previous one. The walkthrough below takes each in turn — in the order we implemented it — and answers three questions: Why the problem exists, Why it works, and What you gain.

## 1. Meta Device + mmap Weight Loading

**Why.** The original loading path had each rank independently call `load_model(load_device="cpu")` before `offload_backend.enable()`. This caused `param.data.copy_(loaded_weight)` to create dp_size complete private copies of the model in RSS. For Cosmos3-Nano DP4, peak RSS was 178 GB — even though the model is only 33 GB.

**Why it works.** The offloader converts already-created DiT modules to the meta device with `to_empty(device="meta")`, releasing their parameter storage while retaining tensor metadata. It then replaces those meta parameters with mmap views from `safe_open().get_tensor()`, which point into the OS page cache rather than private copies.

```python
# distributed_layerwise_backend.py — release existing DiT parameter storage
dit_module.to_empty(device="meta")

# Resolve an HF repo ID, then replace meta parameters with mmap views
model_path = download_weights_from_hf(...)
tensor = safe_open(file_path, framework="pt", device="cpu").get_tensor(ckpt_key)
parent._parameters[name] = Parameter(tensor)  # points to shared page cache
```

Since all ranks mmap the same safetensors files, the OS maintains a single copy of each file page in the page cache — shared across all processes. No rank creates a private copy.

For Hugging Face repo IDs (not local paths), we resolve the snapshot path first via `download_weights_from_hf()`, matching the pattern used by vLLM's existing DiffusersPipelineLoader.

**What you gain.** Cold-start peak RSS drops from 178 GB to 47 GB for Cosmos3-Nano DP4 — a 73% reduction. The 178 GB baseline consists of 132 GB of private model copies, 33 GB of shared page cache, and about 13 GB of framework/transient overhead. The mmap page cache (1× model_size) is shared and read-only, and can be partially reclaimed by the OS under memory pressure.

![Meta-device and mmap loading memory comparison](/assets/figures/2026-07-30-distributed-layerwise-offload/mmap-loading-memory.svg)

*Figure 2: The measured Cosmos3-Nano DP4 cold-start peak falls from 178 GB to 47 GB by replacing four private weight copies with meta parameters backed by one shared mmap page cache.*

## 2. Weight Sharding with AllGather Reconstruction

**Why.** Even with mmap loading, the layerwise offload mechanism still copies the full model into each rank's pinned CPU memory for H2D transfers. With 4 devices, that's 4 × 33 GB = 132 GB of pinned memory — and it scales linearly with device count.

**Why it works.** Instead of storing the full model, each rank stores only 1/dp_size of the weights. At runtime, the full layer weights are reconstructed via `all_gather_into_tensor` on a dedicated communication stream.

```python
# _shard_and_pin: each rank stores only its 1/dp_size shard
shard_size = (total_numel + dp_size - 1) // dp_size  # ceil division
shard = torch.zeros(shard_size, dtype=dtype, device="cpu")
# Copy only the portion within [rank * shard_size, (rank+1) * shard_size)
shard[dst_slice].copy_(mmap_view.flatten()[src_slice])
shard = shard.pin_memory()  # DMA buffer for fast H2D
```

The sharding uses ceil division with zero-padding, so all shards are equal-sized — a requirement for `all_gather_into_tensor`. After sharding, the original mmap views are replaced with zero-element placeholders, releasing the page cache references.

**What you gain.** Total pinned memory drops from dp_size × model_size to model_size (sum across all ranks). For Cosmos3-Super DP4: 4 × 124 GB → 124 GB total, 31 GB per rank.

![Weight sharding and AllGather reconstruction](/assets/figures/2026-07-30-distributed-layerwise-offload/weight-sharding-allgather.svg)

*Figure 3: Host-resident weights shrink from one full model per rank to one shard per rank; AllGather reconstructs only the current full layer on each device.*

## 3. Double-Buffered Prefetch with H2D + AllGather Overlap

**Why.** Sharding solved the memory problem, but each layer still needs its full weights on-device during computation. If we load all layers at once, HBM fills up — the original problem returns. Synchronous loading (H2D → wait → AllGather → wait → compute) also wastes time: the GPU sits idle during data movement.

**Why it works.** We maintain exactly two device buffers (slots), each sized to the largest block in the model. While the compute stream executes layer N (using slot 0), background streams prepare layer N+1 into slot 1:

![DLO Double-Buffer Prefetch Pipeline](/assets/figures/2026-07-30-distributed-layerwise-offload/dlo_pipeline.gif)

*Animation: Three-stream timeline showing Compute (blue), H2D (orange), and AllGather (green) overlapped via double-buffered slots. Red dashed arrows indicate event synchronization — compute waits for AllGather to complete before switching slots.*

The two-stage preparation runs on separate streams:

1. **H2D** (`copy_stream`): load 1/dp_size shard from pinned CPU to device
2. **AllGather** (`comm_stream`): gather shards from all ranks into the full-weight buffer

Both streams are overlapped with the compute stream via event-based synchronization. After AllGather completes, parameters are re-pointed to slices of the output buffer using cached metadata.

The buffers are shared across all blocks — allocated once to the max block size, reused for every layer. This ensures HBM usage is bounded by 2 × max_block_size, independent of the total number of layers.

On Ascend NPU, `pin_memory()` allocates DMA-capable memory via `/dev/davinci_manager` (the NPU device driver). This memory resides in CPU kernel space and is not tracked by cgroup — a key finding that explains why cgroup peak is much lower than expected.

**What you gain.** HBM holds only 2 layers of weights (~2 GB for Nano, ~3 GB for Super), regardless of model size. In the measured `dist_offload+SP` 720p 10s workload, peak HBM grows about 22% (23.1 → 28.1 GB) from Nano to Super; idle HBM grows about 27% (11.5 → 14.6 GB). The model is 3.8× larger, but both HBM measurements remain well below 64 GB.

![HBM usage for Cosmos3-Nano and Cosmos3-Super](/assets/figures/2026-07-30-distributed-layerwise-offload/hbm-nano-vs-super.svg)

*Figure 4: Measured `dist_offload+SP` HBM at 720p 10s. Peak HBM rises about 22% from 23.1 GB to 28.1 GB, while the 124 GB model is 3.8× larger; HSDP+SP reaches 56.3 GB on Super.*

## 4. DP Multi-Concurrency: N Requests in Parallel

**Why.** AllGather only gathers weight shards — it is completely request-independent. This means all DP ranks are synchronized at each AllGather call, but they can compute different activations (different requests) in parallel. Without exploiting this, DP ranks sit idle between AllGather calls, and throughput is limited to 1 request at a time.

**Why it works.** When `dp_concurrent` is enabled, the scheduler batches up to dp_size requests together. The executor sends all requests in a single broadcast RPC:

![DP multi-concurrency request flow](/assets/figures/2026-07-30-distributed-layerwise-offload/dp-multi-concurrency.svg)

*Figure 5: A single broadcast carries a request list; each DP rank computes a different request while synchronized AllGather calls exchange request-independent weight shards.*

```python
# Executor: send all requests at once
reqs_list = [nr.req for nr in new_reqs]
results = collective_rpc("execute_model", args=(reqs_list, ...),
                         unique_reply_rank=None, exec_all_ranks=True)
```

Each worker picks one request based on its DP rank (not global rank, to handle SP/TP correctly):

```python
dp_rank = get_data_parallel_rank()
req = reqs_list[dp_rank % len(reqs_list)]
```

Only the primary rank within each DP replica (SP=0, TP=0, CFG=0, PP=0) replies, tagged with `dp_rank` for result matching. The executor collects responses via round-robin polling and sorts by `dp_rank` to match results to requests.

A validation step rejects concurrent requests with different `num_inference_steps` — since AllGather is a collective, mismatched step counts would cause one rank to exit early while others hang.

**What you gain.** 4 concurrent requests achieve 3.22 generated video frames/s — 3.3× the HSDP single-request baseline, or about 83% of the ideal 4× scaling. The fixed AllGather overhead (~150 ms/step) is amortized across 4 concurrent computations.

## Memory Model: Why It Is Not 2× Model Size

A naive analysis would expect 2× model_size in host memory: page cache (1× model) + shard buffers (1× model total). But on Ascend NPU, `pin_memory()` allocates via `/dev/davinci_manager`, placing the shard in CPU kernel DMA memory that is invisible to the cgroup memory controller.

![Ascend host and HBM memory accounting](/assets/figures/2026-07-30-distributed-layerwise-offload/ascend-memory-accounting.svg)

*Figure 6: Ascend memory accounting for Cosmos3-Nano DP2. The cgroup sees shared page cache and framework RSS, while pinned shards allocated through `/dev/davinci_manager` reside in driver-managed CPU DMA memory rather than NPU HBM.*

Verified with clean measurements (Cosmos3-Nano DP2, fresh cgroup):

```
cgroup usage_in_bytes = 49 GB = cache(31) + rss(18)  ← exact match, no extra
cgroup kmem           = 0 GB
davinci_manager RSS   = 0 kB  (in /proc/<pid>/smaps)
NPU HBM per card      = 10 GB  (< 14.5 GB shard → shard NOT in HBM)
Slab                  = 3.3 GB  (too small for 29 GB shard)
```

| Component | Location | Size | Tracked by cgroup? |
|-----------|----------|------|:------------------:|
| Safetensors page cache | System RAM (user space, shared) | 1× model_size | ✓ (cache) |
| Framework (Python/torch/HCCL) | System RAM (user space, per-rank) | ~3.5 GB × dp_size | ✓ (rss) |
| Shard (pinned) | CPU kernel DMA (/dev/davinci_manager) | model_size / dp_size per rank | ✗ |
| Prefetch buffers | NPU HBM | 2 × block_size per rank | ✗ |

This means cgroup-visible memory scales as O(model_size + dp_size × constant), not O(dp_size × model_size). For a 200B model with dp_size=4: ~423 GB cgroup + ~400 GB kernel DMA = ~823 GB total physical RAM (fits in 2 TB), vs. 2000 GB without mmap.

## Validation Results

All tests on Ascend 910B3 (64 GB HBM/card, 2 TB system RAM), Cosmos3-Nano (33 GB) and Cosmos3-Super (124 GB).

### Correctness

| Model | Config | Requests | HTTP | Frames | Video |
|-------|--------|:--------:|:----:|:------:|:-----:|
| Nano (33 GB) | DP2 | 2 concurrent, 35 steps | 2/2 × 200 | 29/29 | OK |
| Nano (33 GB) | DP4 | 4 concurrent, 35 steps | 4/4 × 200 | 29/29 | OK |
| Super (124 GB) | DP2 | 1 request, 5 steps | 200 | 29 | OK |
| Super (124 GB) | DP4 | 1 request, 5 steps | 200 | 29 | OK |

### Host Memory (cgroup peak)

| Model | Config | cgroup Peak | Page Cache | RSS | Per-worker HWM | vs. Baseline |
|-------|--------|:-----------:|:---------:|:---:|:--------------:|:------------:|
| Nano (33 GB) | DP4 (mmap) | 47 GB | 31 GB | 14 GB | 12.1 GB | — |
| Nano (33 GB) | DP4 (no mmap) | 178 GB | — | — | 36 GB | -73% |
| Super (124 GB) | DP2 | 157 GB | 149 GB | 7 GB | 65.2 GB | — |
| Super (124 GB) | DP4 | 172 GB | 149 GB | 14 GB | 35.5 GB | — |

### NPU HBM

| Model | Config | HBM/card (idle) | HBM/card (inference) | 64 GB Headroom |
|-------|--------|:---------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------:|
| Nano (33 GB) | DP2 | 9.9 GB | 10.4 GB | 55 GB |
| Nano (33 GB) | DP4 | 9.4 GB | 10.2 GB | 55 GB |
| Super (124 GB) | DP2 | ~15 GB | — | ~49 GB |
| Super (124 GB) | DP4 | ~10 GB | — | ~54 GB |

For the measured `dist_offload+SP` 720p 10s workload, peak HBM grows about 22% from Nano to Super (23.1 → 28.1 GB), while idle HBM grows about 27% (11.5 → 14.6 GB). Only 2 layers of weights reside on device, so the 3.8× larger model remains well below the 64 GB limit.

### Performance

These Ascend measurements use Cosmos3-Nano at 832×480, 29 frames, and 35 denoising steps. **Generated frames/s** is aggregate output video frames produced per wall-clock second (`29 frames × outputs per wave / wave latency`), not the video's playback frame rate.

| Strategy | Per-step (ms) | Generated frames/s | CPU/rank | HBM/card | vs. HSDP |
|----------|:-------------:|:------------------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| HSDP+SP (baseline) | 870 | 0.967 | 0 GB | 20.3 GB | — |
| dist_offload+AG (DP4, 1 req) | 1,020 | 0.806 | 3.5 GB | 12.4 GB | -17% |
| dist_offload+AG (DP4, 4 req) | 1,020 | 3.22 | 3.5 GB | 12.4 GB | 3.3× |
| dist_offload no-AG | 1,877 | 0.439 | 28.3 GB | 14.1 GB | -55% |

AllGather overhead = 150 ms/step (72 ms stream switch + 10 ms HCCL + 68 ms Python dispatch), model-size independent. With 4 concurrent requests, this fixed cost is amortized 4×.

### NVIDIA B300 GPU Results

To validate platform-agnosticism, we ran the same DLO stack on NVIDIA B300 SXM6 GPUs. All tests use Cosmos3-Super BF16 (124 GB), 4× NVIDIA B300 (physical GPUs 1,5,6,7), Python 3.12.3, PyTorch 2.11.0+cu130, CUDA 13.0, vLLM 0.25.0.

Correctness was verified via byte-identical output hashes across all strategies. For example, T2I seed 42 produced identical SHA256 `6e7d2a8c63b88391...` across DLO+AG, no-AG, DLO+USP4, legacy layerwise+USP4, and HSDP+USP4. T2V 832×480×29f seed 17 produced identical 666,029-byte output (SHA256 `c5d38f5d21ca619e...`) across all strategies.

CUDA process-tree PSS includes the shared page cache, pinned CPU shards, and framework memory. Ascend cgroup measurements exclude `/dev/davinci_manager`-backed pinned shards, so the GPU PSS and Ascend cgroup figures are not directly comparable.

#### 1024×1024 T2I, 50 steps

| Strategy | Concurrency | Wave latency | Throughput | Process-tree PSS | Peak HBM/card |
|----------|:-----------:|:------------:|:----------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|
| DLO+AG DP4 | 4 | 43.69s (median) | 0.0915 outputs/s | 198–202 GiB | 12.62 GiB |
| DLO no-AG DP4 | 4 | 112.96s | 0.0354 outputs/s | 532 GiB | 11.43 GiB |
| HSDP+USP4 | 1 | 15.19s | 0.0658 outputs/s | 483 GiB | 42.00 GiB |
| legacy layerwise+USP4 | 1 | 105.22s | 0.0095 outputs/s | 533 GiB | 13.99 GiB |

DLO+AG DP4 with 4 concurrent requests achieves **1.39×** the throughput of HSDP+USP4, while using only **30%** of the HBM (12.6 GiB vs 42.0 GiB).

| 480p, 29f | DLO+AG DP4 | 4 | 38.79s | 14.55 GiB | 1 | 15.38s | 43.77 GiB |
| 480p, ~5s (121f) | DLO+AG DP4 | 4 | 102.58s | 15.88 GiB | 1 | 41.36s (125f) | 53.73–62.65 GiB |
| 480p, ~10s (241f) | DLO+AG DP4 | 4 | 226.70s | 17.33 GiB | 1 | 82.47s (245f) | 53.74 GiB |
| 720p, 5s (121f) | DLO+AG DP4 | 4 | 288.29s | 24.95 GiB | 1 | 87.47s | 52.19 GiB |
| 720p, 10s (241f) | DLO+AG+USP4 | 1 | 214.53s | 24.99 GiB | 1 | 210.05s | 53.73 GiB |

On 720p 10s (241f), DLO+AG+USP4 completed in 214.53s — within **2.13%** of HSDP's 210.05s — with byte-identical output (SHA256 `08cb679322996ea6...`), while using only **47%** of HSDP's HBM (24.99 GiB vs 53.73 GiB).

#### MiniMax-H3 on 8× B300: DLO mode is topology-dependent

A separate [MiniMax-H3 B300 study](https://github.com/lishunyang12/vllm-omni-rankings/tree/main/scripts/minimax_h3_b300_dlo_industrial_report) by Shunyang Li tests how DP, SP, and the DLO execution mode interact on one 8× NVIDIA B300 SXM6 AC node. Unlike the Cosmos3 measurements above, this workload generates video **and** audio: 768×1344, 124 video frames, stereo audio, BF16, batch size 1 per replica, and 50 requested steps (49 scheduler denoising updates). Each selected T2VA route below contains 20 measured waves across two engine lifecycles after one full warmup per lifecycle. Throughput is output count divided by wave time; energy integrates summed eight-GPU board power per output without subtracting an idle baseline; an external `nvidia-smi` sampler recorded memory and power at a 0.758s median interval.

![Topology-aware DLO policy for MiniMax-H3 on eight B300 GPUs](/assets/figures/2026-07-30-distributed-layerwise-offload/minimax-h3-topology-policy.svg)

*Figure 7: The measured service frontier within the three evaluated routes. Increasing DP trades per-wave latency for concurrent output capacity; the preferred DLO mode changes from AllGather to rank-local at DP8×SP1.*

| Service objective | Topology / DLO mode | Wave P50 | Wave P95 | Sustained throughput | Measured peak/GPU | Board energy/video |
|-------------------|---------------------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------------------:|:-----------------:|:------------------:|
| Lowest latency | DP1×SP8 / AllGather | 34.55s | 35.25s | 103.84 videos/h | 26.37 GiB | 68.08 Wh |
| Balanced knee | DP4×SP2 / AllGather | 94.73s | 95.31s | 151.89 videos/h | 25.11 GiB | 51.76 Wh |
| Highest throughput / lowest energy | DP8×SP1 / rank-local | 156.74s | 157.03s | 183.78 videos/h | 20.05 GiB | 43.97 Wh |

The paired five-wave mode comparison explains why there is no single global DLO policy. At DP1×SP8, AllGather uses the SP group and improves throughput by 129.4% while reducing P50 latency by 56.6%. At DP4×SP2, its throughput benefit narrows to 2.2%. At DP8×SP1, AllGather reduces throughput by 4.1%, increases P50 latency by 3.8%, and raises the measured per-GPU peak from 20.03 to 94.03 GiB, so rank-local DLO is preferred. FL2VA first-frame and Ref2VA image+audio tests preserve the same latency-to-throughput ordering.

These results are a topology study, not a universal production claim. DP2×SP4 was not measured; the experiment covers one node, one input set, one resolution and frame count, and shape validation rather than perceptual quality. It used source commit [`9e73ee1`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni/commit/9e73ee1a50ce247c638052011914d8027d717f28) plus a recorded local subgroup-broadcast fix, and the runtime warned that the tested vLLM-Omni and vLLM versions were not release-aligned.
