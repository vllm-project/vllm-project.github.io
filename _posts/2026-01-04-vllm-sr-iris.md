We are thrilled to announce the release of **vLLM Semantic Router v0.1**, codename **Iris**—our first major release that marks a transformative milestone for intelligent LLM routing. Since our experimental launch in September 2025, we've witnessed extraordinary community growth: over **600 Pull Requests** merged, **300+ Issues** addressed, and contributions from more than **50 outstanding engineers worldwide**. As we kick off 2026, we're excited to deliver a production-ready semantic routing platform that has evolved dramatically from its origins.

## Why Iris?

In Greek mythology, Iris (Ἶρις) served as the divine messenger who bridged the realms of gods and mortals, traveling on the arc of the rainbow to deliver messages across vast distances. This symbolism perfectly captures what vLLM Semantic Router v0.1 achieves: **a bridge between users and diverse AI models**, intelligently routing requests across different LLM providers and architectures.

## What's New in v0.1 Iris?

### 1. Architecture Overhaul: Signal-Decision Plugin Chain Architecture

**Before:** The early Semantic Router relied on a single-dimensional approach—classifying queries into one of 14 MMLU domain categories with statically orchestrated jailbreak, PII, and semantic caching capabilities.

**Now:** We've introduced the **Signal-Decision Driven Plugin Chain Architecture**, a complete reimagining of semantic routing that scales from 14 fixed categories to unlimited intelligent routing decisions.

The new architecture extracts **six types of signals** from user queries:

- **Domain Signals**: MMLU-trained classification with LoRA extensibility
- **Keyword Signals**: Fast, interpretable regex-based pattern matching
- **Embedding Signals**: Scalable semantic similarity using neural embeddings
- **Factual Signals**: Fact-check classification for hallucination detection
- **Feedback Signals**: User preference and satisfaction indicators
- **Preference Signals**: Personalization based on user history

These signals serve as inputs to a **flexible decision engine** that combines them using AND/OR logic with priority-based selection. Previously static features like jailbreak detection, PII protection, and semantic caching are now configurable **plugins** that users can enable per-decision:

| Plugin | Purpose |
| ------ | ------- |
| `semantic-cache` | Cache similar queries for cost optimization |
| `jailbreak` | Detect prompt injection attacks |
| `pii` | Protect sensitive information |
| `hallucination` | Real-time hallucination detection |
| `system_prompt` | Inject custom instructions |
| `header_mutation` | Modify HTTP headers for metadata propagation |

This modular design enables unlimited extensibility—new signals, plugins, and model selection algorithms can be added without architectural changes. Learn more in our [Signal-Decision Architecture blog post](https://blog.vllm.ai/2025/11/19/signal-decision.html).

### 2. Performance Optimization: Modular LoRA Architecture

In collaboration with the **Hugging Face Candle team**, we've completely refactored the router's inference kernel. The previous implementation required loading and running multiple fine-tuned models independently—computational cost grew linearly with the number of classification tasks.

![](/assets/figures/semantic-router/iris-3.png)

**The breakthrough:** By adopting **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**, we now share base model computation across all classification tasks:

| Approach | Workload                                         | Scalability     |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| Before   | N full model forward passes                      | O(n)            |
| After    | 1 base model pass + N lightweight LoRA adapters  | O(1) + O(n×ε)   |

This architecture delivers **significant latency reduction** while enabling multi-task classification on the same input. See the full technical details in our [Modular LoRA blog post](https://blog.vllm.ai/2025/10/27/semantic-router-modular.html).

### 3. Safety Enhancement: HaluGate Hallucination Detection

Beyond request-time safety (jailbreak, PII), v0.1 introduces **HaluGate**—a three-stage hallucination detection pipeline for LLM responses:

**Stage 1: HaluGate Sentinel** – Binary classification determining if a query warrants factual verification (creative writing and code don't need fact-checking).

**Stage 2: HaluGate Detector** – Token-level detection identifying exactly which tokens in the response are unsupported by the provided context.

**Stage 3: HaluGate Explainer** – NLI-based classification explaining *why* each flagged span is problematic (CONTRADICTION vs NEUTRAL).

HaluGate integrates seamlessly with function-calling workflows—tool results serve as ground truth for verification. Detection results are propagated via HTTP headers, enabling downstream systems to implement custom policies. Dive deeper in our [HaluGate blog post](https://blog.vllm.ai/2025/12/14/halugate.html).

### 4. UX Improvements: One-Command Installation

### 6. MoM (Mixture of Models) Family

| Model | Purpose |
| ----- | ------- |
| `mom-domain-classifier` | MMLU-based domain classification |
| `mom-pii-classifier` | PII detection and protection |
| `mom-jailbreak-classifier` | Prompt injection detection |

All MoM models are specifically trained and optimized for vLLM Semantic Router, providing consistent performance across routing scenarios.

### 7. Responses API Support

We now support the **OpenAI Responses API** (`/v1/responses`) with in-memory conversation state management:

- **Stateful Conversations**: Built-in state management with `previous_response_id` chaining
- **Multi-turn Context**: Automatic context preservation across conversation turns
- **Routing Continuity**: Intent classification history maintained across the conversation

This enables intelligent routing for modern agent frameworks and multi-turn applications.

### 8. Tool Selection

Intelligent tool management for agentic workflows:

- **Semantic Tool Filtering**: Automatically filter irrelevant tools before sending to LLM
- **Context-Aware Selection**: Consider conversation history and task requirements
- **Reduced Token Usage**: Smaller tool catalogs mean faster inference and lower costs
