We are excited to announce the official release of [**vLLM-Omni**](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni), a major extension of the vLLM ecosystem designed to support the next generation of AI: omni-modality models.

Since its inception, vLLM has focused on high-throughput, memory-efficient serving for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the landscape of generative AI is shifting rapidly. Models are no longer just about text-in, text-out. Today's state-of-the-art models reason across text, images, audio, and video, and they generate heterogeneous outputs using diverse architectures. 

**vLLM-Omni** is one of the first open source frameworks to support omni-modality model serving that extends vLLM’s exceptional performance to the world of multi-modal and non-autoregressive inference.

## **Why vLLM-Omni?**

Traditional serving engines were optimized for text-based Autoregressive (AR) tasks. As models evolve into "omni" agents—capable of seeing, hearing, and speaking—the serving infrastructure must evolve with them.

vLLM-Omni addresses three critical shifts in model architecture:

1. **True Omni-Modality:** Processing and generating Text, Image, Video, and Audio seamlessly.  
2. **Beyond Autoregression:** Extending vLLM's efficient memory management to **Diffusion Transformers (DiT)** and other parallel generation models.  
3. **Heterogeneous Model Pipeline:** Orchestrating complex model workflows where a single request can invoke multiple heterogeneous model components. (e.g, multimodal encoding, AR reasoning, diffusion-based multimodal generation, etc).

## **Inside the Architecture**

vLLM-Omni is more than a wrapper; it is a re-imagining of data flow within and beyond vLLM. It introduces a fully disaggregated pipeline that allows for dynamic resource allocation across different stages of generation. As shown above, the architecture unifies distinct phases:

* **Modality Encoders:** Efficiently encoding multimodal inputs (ViT, Whisper, etc.)  
* **LLM Core:** Leveraging vLLM for autoregressive text & hidden states generation with one or more language models.
* **Modality Generators:** High-performance serving for DiT and other decoding heads to produce rich media outputs.

### **Key Features**

</p>  

* **Simplicity:** If you know how to use vLLM, you know how to use vLLM-Omni. We maintain seamless integration with Hugging Face models and offer an OpenAI-compatible API server.  

* **Flexibility:** With the OmniStage abstraction, we provide a simple and straightforward way to support various omni-modality models including Qwen-Omni, Qwen-Image, and other state-of-the-art models.

* **Performance:** We utilize pipelined stage execution to overlap computation for high throughput performance, ensuring that while one stage is processing, others aren't idle.

We benchmarked vLLM-Omni against Hugging Face Transformers to demonstrate the efficiency gains in omni-modal serving.

## **Future Roadmap**

vLLM-Omni is evolving rapidly. Our roadmap is focused on expanding model support and pushing the boundaries of efficient inference even further as well as building the right framework to empower future research on omni-modality models.

* **Expanded Model Support:** We plan to support a wider range of open-source omni-models and diffusion transformers as they emerge.  
* **Adaptive Framework Refinement**: We will continue to evolve and improve the framework to support emerging omni-modality models and execution patterns, ensuring that it remains a reliable foundation for both production workloads and cutting-edge research. 
* **Deeper vLLM Integration:** merging core omni-features upstream to make multi-modality a first-class citizen in the entire vLLM ecosystem.
* **Diffusion Acceleration:** parallel inference(DP/TP/SP/USP...),  cache acceleration(TeaCache/DBCache...) and compute acceleration(quantization/sparse attention...).
* **Full disaggregation:** Based on the OmniStage abstraction, we expect to support full disaggregation (encoder/prefill/decode/generation) across different inference stages in order to improve throughput and reduce latency.
* **Hardware Support:** Following the hardware plugin system, we plan to expand our support for various hardware backends to ensure vLLM-Omni runs efficiently everywhere.  


## **Getting Started**

Getting started with vLLM-Omni is straightforward. The initial vllm-omni v0.11.0rc release is built on top of vLLM v0.11.0. 

### **Installation**

Check out our [Installation Doc](https://vllm-omni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation/) for details.

### **Serving the omni-modality models**

Check out our [examples directory](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni/tree/main/examples) for specific scripts to launch image, audio, and video generation workflows. vLLM-Omni also provides the gradio support to improve user experience, below is a demo example for serving Qwen-Image:
