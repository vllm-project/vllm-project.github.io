# vLLM blog source

## Local development

1. Install `jekyll` and `bundler` by running `gem install jekyll bundler`. Ask ChatGPT for help if you encounter any issues.
2. `bundle install` to install the necessary gems.
3. `rm ./Gemfile.lock` if you meet gem error.
5. `bundle exec jekyll server` to compile and start the server.

To add a new blogpost, please refer to `_posts/2023-06-20-vllm.md` as an example. Some notes:
- Google Doc can be saved as markdown format which will make your life easier.
- Note that the blogpost will only show when its date is in the past.
- Put figures under `assets/figures/yourblogname/`.
- Make a pull request.

The blog is automatically built and deployed by GitHub Actions when `main` is pushed to.

## LaTeX Math

The blog supports LaTeX math via [MathJax](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/index.html). 

It can be enabled by adding `math: true` to the document frontmatter. It has been configured to support the standard LaTeX style math notation, i.e.:

```latex
$ inline math $
```

```latex
$$
math block
$$
```

## Theme customization

The theme we are using is [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). If you need to customise anything from this theme, see [Overriding theme defaults](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#overriding-theme-defaults).
